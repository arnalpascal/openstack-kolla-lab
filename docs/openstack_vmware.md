- Same problem as IaaS vs Hypervisor
- VMWare proprietary solution
- Has additional extensions to make it Cloud, such as vSAN, NSX, vRealize, ...
- Each component requires an additional license, difficult to control costs
- OpenStack opensource solution designed as an IaaS solution
- Multiple distribution available such as RedHat OpenStack Platform, Canonical's Charmed OpenStack, ...
- Important component catalog in addition to the basic components (Trove DBaaS, Murano Application Catalog,â€¦) <sup>*</sup>
